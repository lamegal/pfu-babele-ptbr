## Important Notice

With the exception of English and Italian compendium localization (which is covered under the [Fabula Ultima Third-Party Tabletop License 1.0](https://need.games/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Fabula-Ultima-Third-Party-Tabletop-License-1.0.pdf)), 
please do not share your localization module on official channels (e.g., Reddit, Discord, including Rooster Games and Need Games), as well as the PFU developer Discord. Only until your language's publisher releases a third party license of their own, will you be permitted to share your localization.

I cannot be held responsible for anyone who disregards these guidelines.
